# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
  # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
  # The 'pluginClass' specifies the class (in Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, etc.)
  # which should be registered in the plugin registry. This is required for
  # using method channels.
  # The Android 'package' specifies package in which the registered class is.
  # This is required for using method channels on Android.
  # The 'ffiPlugin' specifies that native code should be built and bundled.
  # This is required for using `dart:ffi`.
  # All these are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
  # adding or updating assets for this project.
  plugin:
    platforms:
    # This plugin project was generated without specifying any
    # platforms with the `--platform` argument. If you see the `some_platform` map below, remove it and
    # then add platforms following the instruction here:
    # https://flutter.dev/to/pubspec-plugin-platforms
    # -------------------
      some_platform:
        pluginClass: somePluginClass
    # -------------------

  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: TractianIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/tractian_icons.ttf
    - family: Roboto-Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Medium.ttf
    - family: Roboto-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
